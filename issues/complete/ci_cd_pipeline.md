# Setup CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

## Description
Implement continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automatically test the parser with all extracted samples and ensure code quality. This is mentioned as a next step in PROJECT_STATUS.md.

## Requirements
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow
2. Run tests on multiple Rust versions
3. Test against all 2,285 extracted samples
4. Run clippy and rustfmt checks
5. Generate and publish documentation
6. Calculate and report code coverage

## GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        rust: [stable, beta, nightly]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@master
      with:
        toolchain: ${{ matrix.rust }}
    - run: cargo test --all-features
    - run: cargo test --no-default-features
    
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - run: cargo fmt -- --check
    - run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings
    
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: taiki-e/install-action@cargo-llvm-cov
    - run: cargo llvm-cov --codecov --output-path codecov.xml
    - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Additional Workflows
- Benchmark regression testing
- Security audit (cargo-audit)
- Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- Release automation with changelog

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass on every commit
- Code coverage reported and tracked
- Linting errors block merging
- Documentation automatically updated
- Performance regressions detected
